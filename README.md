# rstudioaddins

An R package of custom [RStudio
Addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/), mostly for “missing”
keyboard shortcuts, such as the forward assignment operator `->` and the
[gestalt](https://github.com/egnha/gestalt) compose operator `%>>>%`.
Requires [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) v0.99.878
or later.

(Presently, this is just for my personal use.)

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("egnha/rstudioaddins")
```
